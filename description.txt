Regen From Bosses makes your character regenerate some life per second, based on the amount of bosses that you have slain at least once in a world.

This mod exists to make Squire's Great Helm and Valhalla Knight's Breastplate less essential for people who don't want to use consumable health potions, although this mod can stack with those items.

This mod seems to have no effect in multiplayer - I don't know why.

This mod should currently support bosses from the following:
Terraria v1.3.5.2
Example Mod v0.11.3
The Antiaris v0.1.0.11
Calamity Mod (No Calamity Music) v1.4.2.103
Crystilium v11.3.1.5
Echoes of the Ancients v0.1.1
Exodus Mod v1.1.0.1
Ocram 'n Stuff v1.0.2.4
Pumpking's Mod v1.1.4.1
Mod of Redemption v0.7.5.3
Spirit Mod v1.3.4.1
Tremor Mod Remastered v1.3.2.7
Thorium Mod v1.5.1.2
Varia (Open Beta) v1.0.5.1
W1K's Mod Redux v1.1.1

"Integration" with the Boss Checklist mod has been considered for wide automatic mod-boss support, but it seems impossible to me at the moment.


Changelog:

Version 3.1:
- Updated support for Mod of Redemption

Version 3.0.2:
- Fixed two "sums" in the mod configuration menu being listed at wrong places in the menu

Version 3.0.1:
- Coloured the headers in the mod configuration menu for this mod, just to make it look prettier
- Minor source code cleanup

Version 3.0:
- Updated to tModLoader 0.11+, and uses the ModConfig system introduced in it
- (This means that any configuration from previous versions before 3.0 no longer applies, though the new method is more user-friendly)
- You can now adjust how much maximum life regeneration you can obtain by slaying all bosses/mini-bosses/events in a world, and how much it stacks with life regeneration from other sources, within the game
- Now supports additional life regeneration for slaying mini-bosses and events, as well as an always-active passive bonus, although none of those things are enabled by default (though they can be configured in-game)
- You can now also make it so that this mod gives you some extra mana regeneration. This is also disabled by default... but you can configure it if you really want to, because "why not". This is not tested yet
- No longer hangs in multiplayer... but based on one-player tests, doesn't seem to have any effect in it, anyway... So, multiplayer is still not supported, but at least playable now?
- Updated support for Calamity Mod (No Calamity Music)

Version 2.1:
- Added support for Tremor Mod Remastered and Varia (Open Beta)
- Updated support for Calamity Mod (No Calamity Music), Mod of Redemption, Thorium Mod, and Spirit Mod
- (All supported mods are now fully supported; No mods are only partially supported anymore)
- No longer recalculates the life regeneration amount upon respawning. Considering that it recalculates it when slaying a boss or re-joining the world, that should be often enough.

Version 2.0:
- Life regeneration is now based on the percentage of bosses that have been slain
- (This means that you won't get a higher maximum regeneration by using lots of boss-adding mods)
- The maximum regeneration amount can be adjusted in the configuration file: -/Terraria/ModLoader/Mod Configs/RegenFromBosses.json
- The default is up to 10 life per second (which is 20 in the config)
- (The previous maximum from vanilla Terraria's bosses was 7 per second, so this is a slight buff if no more than 6 mod bosses are also added, but a nerf if so)
- Partial rewrite and more restructuring of the source code
- Some "debug" stuff is now displayed when calculating the regeneration if Modder's Toolkit is loaded
- In theory, multiplayer synchronization has been improved much more, but in practice, it has been completely destroyed

Version 1.2:
- Added full support for Mod of Redemption

Version 1.1:
- Added full support for Crystilium, Echoes of the Ancients, Example Mod, Exodus Mod, Pumpking's Mod, and W1K's Mod Redux
- Added partial support for Spirit Mod
- Restructuring of the source code
- Possible multiplayer synchronization improvement, although multiplayer synchronization was unknown before and is still unknown, so whether it's better, worse, or unchanged is unknown

Version 1.0.0.1:
- Hotfix for The Antiaris mod support checking Calamity Mod's bosses instead, causing double-regen from Calamity Mod or a crash if Calamity Mod is not loaded when Antiaris is

Version 1.0:
- Initial release
- Added full support for The Antiaris and Ocram 'n Stuff
- Added partial support for Calamity Mod and Thorium Mod
